# Amazone-clone in Reactjs

I am developing amazon-clone with following the video from cleverprogrammer[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDV3Z1KCBvo&t=394s] as part of the practice to becoming credible software engineer and building on the knowledge I am learning from Udacity (African App Launchpad scholarship program).

This is contibuting to the e-commerce website I am building to be rolled out by January 2022. This e-commerce will assist small and medium businesses in Uganda see their products online. This is the best way I am applying the knowledge I am learning from Holberton School (ALX Software Engineering programme) and Udacity (African App Launchpad Scholarship programme).

To support or collaborate on building the e-commerce website, please contact me.
